## Implementation approach

We will create a simple Python console application that meets the requirement of outputting the word 'hi'. To ensure cross-platform compatibility, we will use Python's built-in capabilities, avoiding any platform-specific libraries. The application will be packaged using PyInstaller to create executables for different operating systems, ensuring easy accessibility. We will adhere to PEP8 standards for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## File list

- main.py

## Data structures and interfaces

classDiagram
    class SimpleHiProgram {
        +main() str
    }
    SimpleHiProgram : +output_hi() str
    
    class SimpleHiProgram {
        +output_hi() str {
            print('hi')
        }
    }

## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant SHP as SimpleHiProgram
    U->>SHP: Execute main.py
    SHP->>SHP: output_hi()
    SHP-->>U: 'hi'
