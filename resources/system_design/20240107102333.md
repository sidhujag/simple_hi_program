## Implementation approach

We will develop a straightforward Python console application named 'simple_hi_output' that prints the word 'hi' to the console upon execution. We will utilize Python's standard libraries to ensure cross-platform compatibility and avoid unnecessary complexity. The application will be packaged with PyInstaller to create standalone executables for various operating systems. To maintain simplicity and performance, we will not incorporate a GUI or heavy frameworks, and we will adhere to PEP8 standards for code readability and maintainability.

## File list

- main.py

## Data structures and interfaces

    class SimpleHiProgram {
        +main() str
    }
    SimpleHiProgram : +output_hi() str {
            print('hi')
        }
    }

## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant SHP as SimpleHiProgram
    U->>SHP: Execute main.py
    SHP->>SHP: output_hi()
    SHP-->>U: 'hi'
