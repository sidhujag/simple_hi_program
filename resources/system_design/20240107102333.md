## Implementation approach

We will create a simple Python console application that meets the requirement of outputting the word 'hi'. To ensure cross-platform compatibility, we will use Python's built-in capabilities, avoiding any platform-specific libraries. The application will be packaged using PyInstaller to create executables for different operating systems, ensuring easy accessibility. We will adhere to PEP8 standards for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## System Design Document for 'Hi' Program

### Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for a simple Python program that prints the word 'hi' to the standard output.

### Components

1. **Python Interpreter**: The runtime environment that executes the Python code.

### Interfaces

The program does not have any external interfaces. It interacts with the standard output (stdout) of the system to display the message.

### Data Flow

The program consists of a single operation:

- The Python script is executed by the Python interpreter.
- The `print` function is called with the string 'hi' as an argument.
- The `print` function sends the string 'hi' to the standard output.
- The message 'hi' is displayed on the user's screen.

### Conclusion

The system design for the 'hi' program is straightforward due to its simplicity. It involves a single Python script that uses the built-in `print` function to output a message to the standard output.
