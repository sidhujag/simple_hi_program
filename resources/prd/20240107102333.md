Python

## Original Requirements

Design a system that outputs the word 'hi'.

## Project Name

simple_hi_output

## Product Goals

- Create a user-friendly program with a simple interface
- Ensure the program is lightweight with a fast startup time
- Develop a cross-platform application that is easily maintainable

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the word 'hi' displayed when I run the program
- As a user, I want to be able to run the program on any device without compatibility issues
- As a developer, I want the code to be well-organized and documented so I can make changes or enhancements

## Competitive Analysis

- HelloWorld App: Simple but limited to one platform
- GreetingScript Tool: Supports multiple languages but has performance issues
- HiGenerator 3000: Fast execution but not user-friendly
- QuickGreet App: Quick startup but complex installation process
- UniversalGreeter: Cross-platform but resource-intensive
- SimpleHi: Lightweight but lacks a graphical interface
- HiNow: Instant startup but not maintainable

## Requirement Analysis

The system must be able to display the word 'hi' upon user command. It should be a lightweight application with a quick startup time and be compatible across different operating systems. The codebase needs to be clean, well-documented, and structured for easy future enhancements.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', "The program must display the word 'hi' upon execution."]
- ['P1', 'The application should be cross-platform compatible.']
- ['P1', 'The startup time of the program should be minimal.']
- ['P2', 'The code should be well-documented and structured for maintainability.']
- ['P2', 'The installation process should be straightforward across various platforms.']

## UI Design draft

The UI will be a simple console-based interface that displays the word 'hi' when the program is executed.
