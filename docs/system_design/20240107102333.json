{"Implementation approach": "We will develop a straightforward Python console application named 'simple_hi_output' that prints the word 'hi' to the console upon execution. We will utilize Python's standard libraries to ensure cross-platform compatibility and avoid unnecessary complexity. The application will be packaged with PyInstaller to create standalone executables for various operating systems. To maintain simplicity and performance, we will not incorporate a GUI or heavy frameworks, and we will adhere to PEP8 standards for code readability and maintainability.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "classDiagram\n    class SimpleHiProgram {\n        +main() str\n    }\n    SimpleHiProgram : +output_hi() str {\n            print('hi')\n        }\n    }", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant SHP as SimpleHiProgram\n    U->>SHP: Execute main.py\n    SHP->>SHP: output_hi()\n    SHP-->>U: 'hi'", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}
