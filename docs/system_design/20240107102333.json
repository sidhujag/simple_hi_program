{"Implementation approach": "We will create a simple Python console application that meets the requirement of outputting the word 'hi'. To ensure cross-platform compatibility, we will use Python's built-in capabilities, avoiding any platform-specific libraries. The application will be packaged using PyInstaller to create executables for different operating systems, ensuring easy accessibility. We will adhere to PEP8 standards for a clean and maintainable codebase.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "classDiagram\n    class SimpleHiProgram {\n        +main() str\n    }\n    SimpleHiProgram : +output_hi() str\n    \n    class SimpleHiProgram {\n        +output_hi() str {\n            print('hi')\n        }\n    }", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant SHP as SimpleHiProgram\n    U->>SHP: Execute main.py\n    SHP->>SHP: output_hi()\n    SHP-->>U: 'hi'", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}
